# Gas Emission Monitoring System

The Gas Emission Monitoring System is a web application designed for monitoring and visualizing environmental data, specifically focusing on gas emissions. Developed as a master's level assignment, this project aims to blend academic rigor with practical utility, making it relevant for both educational purposes and real-world environmental analysis.

**Project Overview:**
This system is an end-to-end solution for collecting, analyzing, and presenting data from gas emission sensors. Targeted at environmental analysts, it provides valuable insights into air quality and pollutant levels, and supports informed decision-making in environmental management.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Backend:** Spring Boot for robust application development.
- **Database:** MySQL for efficient data management.
- **Frontend:** Considering React or Angular; React for its simplicity and component-based architecture, and Angular for its scalability and material design capabilities.
- **Testing:** JUnit to ensure the reliability and efficiency of our backend services.
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for streamlined project management and collaboration.
