# GasEmissionMonitoringSystem
This will lay the foundation for the project's overview, specifications, and design.

### README.md Draft

#### Gas Emission Monitoring System

**Project Overview:**
The Gas Emission Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to collect, analyze, and visualize data from gas emission sensors. This project aims to provide real-time insights into environmental data, particularly focusing on air quality and pollutant levels. The application will be useful for environmental analysts and system administrators, facilitating informed decision-making in environmental management and policy.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Frontend:** [JavaScript Framework - to be decided, e.g., React or Angular]
- **Testing:** JUnit

**How to Contribute:**
To contribute to this project:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.

**Installation and Setup:**
*Instructions on how to set up the project locally will be provided as the project develops.*

### Wiki Pages Draft

#### 1. System Specification

**User Types:**
- **Environmental Analysts:** Users who analyze and interpret emission data for environmental assessment.
- **System Administrators:** Users responsible for the maintenance and management of the system.

**Entities:**
- **Sensors:** Devices capturing gas emission data.
- **Emission Data:** Recorded data points from each sensor, including pollutant levels, time stamps, etc.
- **Analysis Reports:** Reports generated for trends, patterns, and detailed analysis of emissions over time.

**Use Cases:**
1. **View Real-Time Emission Data:** Display live data from sensors.
2. **Generate Emission Reports:** Create comprehensive reports based on collected data.
3. **Sensor Management:** Add, remove, or update sensor configurations.
4. **Analyze Historical Data:** Evaluate past emission data for trends and patterns.
5. **Emission Alerts:** Set up and receive alerts for threshold breaches in emission levels.

#### 2. System Design

*This section will include detailed architectural designs and UML diagrams illustrating the system's structure and data flow.*

#### 3. API Documentation

*This section will detail the RESTful API's structure, including descriptions of endpoints, expected inputs, and outputs.*

#### 4. Database Design

### Action Items:

1. **Review and Upload Documentation:**
   - Review the drafts and adjust as needed.
   - Upload the README.md draft to the repository and populate the Wiki pages with the provided content.

2. **Start Initial Design Phase:**
   - Begin creating UML diagrams and architectural designs.
   - Upload these to the `/docs` directory and reference them in the Wiki.

3. **Issue Creation:**
   - Create GitHub Issues for tasks such as designing the database schema and drafting UML diagrams.

Feel free to modify these drafts to better fit your vision for the project. Once the initial documentation is in place, we can proceed with the detailed planning and design phase. Let me know if you need further assistance or have specific requests for the next steps!
